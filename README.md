**How it works**

the project has been uploaded to this [Link](https://snapp-innovations.vercel.app/)

1-please first connect your wallet
2-put a name and a symbol for collection, and click add collection to create a new collection.
  your wallet pops up to confirm the transaction.
  you should wait few seconds for the transaction to go through (when you get confirmation notification from you metamask)
  
 3- click on load collection to see the list of collections you have created.
 4- then MINT new NFT, metamask popsup for confirmation. give it a second for transaction to go through.
    then again load collections (by click on the load colelction button)
 5- then click on update last NFT metadata so the metadata would be update.
    after metadata has been updated and the transaction confirmed, then go to the shown link on opeansea, click on update meta data, and give a second and then refresh the page to see the 
    minted NFT with the picture and info. at the bottom of the page you can see the owner is your accound address
    
 6- to send token you can click send on opensea testnet website (button beside refresh metadata) put an address other than your wallet address.
    you should not be able to send the NFT. go back to the  [Link](https://snapp-innovations.vercel.app/) website, add the address you want to send the NFT token to as a white-list.
    then go back to opensea and try again to send the token, this time you shoudl be able to send the NFT token.
    
 ** please hit "load created collections" in order to have everything updated before doing "minting", "updating metadata" or "add white list".
 
 
 ** i dont have any experience on the front end, so please excuse the messy design.
 
 please look through the contracts either here inside contract folder or on rinkeby explorer [Address](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xa7719E1147746C19E269db95D8b2Ed1EaD5D5c4d)
 
 I have already verified the contracts and you can see everything there as well.
 
 
 ** If you have any question let me know, or we could schedule a call to go through it**
